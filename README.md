# scrapbox8

A comprehensive collection of sample implementations and research code for machine learning, information retrieval, recommendation systems, and Python utilities.

## Overview

This repository contains various sample projects and implementations organized by domain:

- **ML Samples** (`ml_sample/`) - Machine learning models and experiments
- **IR Samples** (`ir_sample/`) - Information retrieval implementations
- **Recommendation Samples** (`rec_sample/`) - Recommendation system algorithms
- **LLM Samples** (`llm_sample/`) - Large language model usage examples
- **Python Samples** (`py_sample/`) - Python utilities and tools
- **TensorFlow Samples** (`tf_sample/`) - TensorFlow implementations
- **Math Samples** (`math_sample/`) - Mathematical algorithms
- **AWS Samples** (`aws_sample/`) - AWS service integrations

## Resources

- **Scrapbox**: https://scrapbox.io/stacker8/

Each sample directory contains standalone implementations with their own `main.py` entry points.
